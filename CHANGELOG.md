    - Implemented fetching of RoPro short links for public server notifications.

### Changed

- Refactored the whole codebase in preperation for bigger updates.

### Fixed

## [1.2.1-Stable] - 2025-04-27

### Added
- **Silly Egg Detection**: Detects the "we're so silly and fun" message, sending a webhook with ðŸ˜‚ emoji and forcing an `@everyone` ping.
- Added Silly Egg entry to the "Pings" tab UI, indicating its forced `@everyone` ping.
- Changed "Username" in hatch tab to "Roblox Username:"

### Changed
- Removed cooldown checks for Aura Egg and Silly Egg webhook notifications. They will now ping every time they are detected.

## [1.2.0-Hotfix] - 2025-04-26

### Fixed
- Ensured hatch notifications (status update and webhook) are only sent if the username found in the log message matches the username configured in the 'Hatch Settings' tab.
- Corrected Discord embed formatting for hatch notifications, ensuring newlines (`\n`) are properly rendered instead of appearing as literal `\\n`.

## [1.2.0-Stable] - 2025-04-26

### Added
- **Hatch Detection Features**:
    - Added a new "Hatch" tab with settings for username, secret pet ping toggle, and user ID for pinging.
    - Implemented detection logic for Secret and Legendary pets based on provided lists.
    - Handles pet mutations (e.g., "Shiny", "Mythic") when checking against lists.
    - Sends Discord webhook notifications for rare hatches, including embed color based on rarity.
    - Option to ping a specific user ID when *their own* configured username hatches a Secret pet.
    - Added a checkbox to enable/disable all hatch detection.
    - Implemented a cooldown period (`last_hatch_ping_time`) for hatch notifications.
    - Configuration saving/loading for all Hatch tab settings.
- **Event Cooldown System**: Implemented a global cooldown (`EVENT_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`) to prevent duplicate webhook pings for Royal Chest and Gum Rift. (Aura Egg excluded from cooldown).
- Automatic FFlags configuration, reducing reliance on external tools like Fishstrap.
- Tutorial link for Collection

### Changed
- Updated application version to `1.2.0-Stable`.
- **Autoupdater Process**: Modified the updater script (`_updater.bat`) generation to instruct the user to manually close the application before the update process replaces the executable.
- Refined FastFlag application logic (`apply_roblox_fastflags`).
- **First-Time Setup Notice**: 
    - Now uses a `tutorial_shown` flag in `config.json` to determine if it should be displayed, instead of just checking for the config file's existence.
    - The "OK" button is disabled for 10 seconds via a `QTimer`.
    - The notice text informs the user about the 10-second delay.
    - The `tutorial_shown` flag is only set to `True` (and saved) if the user explicitly clicks the "OK" button, not if the dialog is closed via the 'X' button.

### Fixed
- Re-added accidentally removed detection logic for Gum Rift and Aura Egg events.
- Improved hatch detection regex to correctly identify pets with mutations (e.g., "Shiny Neon Elemental", "Mythic Seraphic Bunny").
- Resolved an `AttributeError` crash that occurred when `save_config` was called during the first-time setup notice (before the main UI elements were created).

## [1.1.0-Beta] - 2024-04-25 

### Added
- **Collection Path Feature**:
    - Added a new "Collection" tab to the UI.
    - Option to enable/disable the collection path macro.
    - Calibration system (single click) to define the teleport button location.
    - Coordinates displayed below the calibration button.
    - Collection process runs concurrently with rift scanning.
    - Uses `autoit.mouse_click` via `pyautoit` wrapper.
    - 3-second delay added after teleport click.
- Global hotkeys (F1 Start, F2 Stop) using `pynput` listener, replacing `QShortcut` to work when the window isn't focused.
- Added Ping Selection

### Changed
- Updated application version constant to `1.1.0-Beta`.
- Required dependencies now include `pynput`, `pyautogui`, and `pyautoit` (which itself requires AutoIt to be installed).

- Updated text in the Credits tab.

### Fixed
- Fixed various bugs related to calibration state management (`AttributeError` and `NoneType` errors).
