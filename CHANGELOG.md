## [1.1.0-Beta] - 2024-04-25 

### Added
- **Collection Path Feature**:
    - Added a new "Collection" tab to the UI.
    - Option to enable/disable the collection path macro.
    - Calibration system (single click) to define the teleport button location.
    - Coordinates displayed below the calibration button.
    - Collection process runs concurrently with rift scanning.
    - Uses `autoit.mouse_click` via `pyautoit` wrapper.
    - 3-second delay added after teleport click.
- Global hotkeys (F1 Start, F2 Stop) using `pynput` listener, replacing `QShortcut` to work when the window isn't focused.
- Added Ping Selection

### Changed
- Updated application version constant to `1.1.0-Beta`.
- Required dependencies now include `pynput`, `pyautogui`, and `pyautoit` (which itself requires AutoIt to be installed).
- Moved "Credits" tab to be the last tab in the UI.
- Updated text in the Credits tab.

### Fixed
- Fixed various bugs related to calibration state management (`AttributeError` and `NoneType` errors).
- Fixed `UnboundLocalError` related to `launcher_frame` in `build_ui`.

## [1.0.1-Beta] - 2025-04-23

### Added
- Gum Rift detection for the message "Bring us your gum, Earthlings!" with pink notification color and bubble emoji (ðŸ«§).
- Added better FFLags addition
- Added Log Detection Modes

## [1.0.0-Alpha2] - 2025-04-21  

### Added
- Automatic configuration of Roblox FastFlags (`ClientAppSettings.json`) on startup to enable necessary logging for detection.
- Input field for "Discord Ping ID" (User or Role) to specify mentions for Royal Chest notifications.
- First-launch warning `QMessageBox` instructing users to ensure Roblox is closed before starting RiftScope initially to allow for proper FastFlag setup.

### Changed
- Aura Egg notifications now always ping `@everyone` instead of a specific ID.
- Updated application version constant to `1.0.0-Alpha2`.

### Fixed
- Resolved a startup crash where the FastFlag configuration logic tried to update UI elements (`status_label`) before they were created.

### Removed
- The status label widget previously displayed below the buttons on the "Scanner" tab. Status updates are now only shown in the "Logs" tab and console output.

- `Worker` QThread class to run background tasks (monitoring, testing, update checking) without freezing the UI.
- Input fields for Discord Webhook URL and optional Private Server Link.
